HI, my name is Alex Kondratiuk. I am currently in my senior year at NYU where I have been majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Studies, aiming to carve out a niche for myself in the world of software engineering.

### More Information

Diving deep into my academic journey, I spent my freshman year at Villanova University. Here, I not only expanded my horizons in Computer Science but also developed a keen interest in Cybersecurity. My passion for tech innovation saw me joining the programming teams both at Villanova and NYU, where I engaged in hackathons and crafted themed projects. One project that stands out was a handy app prototype designed to help college students connect during the stringent COVID-19 restrictions.

While at Villanova University, I also became a research assistant to a Cybersecurity Professor. Our research focused on identifying vulnerabilities in Provenance-Based IoT Systems devices that were being exploited by malicious intruders to view live feeds of victim’s activity. In order to insure the integrity of data we used data provenance to track down activities and built graphs with Neo4j.

In the summer of 2021, I had an invaluable opportunity to intern for DIIA at the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine as a Software Engineer. There, I was part of the team that developed the first legalized digital identity mobile application in Ukraine. I delved into enhancing the user interface and usability of the app, incorporating features like chip scanning for passport registration. This manual guide was subsequently launched nationwide. Moreover, my contributions extended to improving DIIA’s website, focusing on verified electronic document signatures. The use of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques significantly boosted the website’s visibility. An exciting project I took part in was beta testing the electronic COVID-19 vaccination certificates, marking a significant step in the nation’s battle against the pandemic.

The following year, 2022, I interned as a Software Engineer at Bancroft Architects + Engineers, a veteran-owned architecture and engineering firm located in Chicago. At Bancroft, I was handed real-world problems that required practical software solutions. One of my primary projects was to create a user-friendly software solution using Microsoft Power Apps, which greatly benefited the marketing team by saving them a significant amount of time. Additionally, I proposed data management solutions tailored to the Project Management team’s needs, ensuring enhanced project visibility and performance across the firm.

Currently, I serve as a Software Engineering & Product Management Contractor at Vociferous.io, a specialized web application development firm that focuses on empowering non-profits and media businesses through the application of AI in communications. As the sole developer on an ambitious project, I’m building a Media Campaign Management Console designed to optimize communication strategies. The console, developed on AWS, incorporates various services such as DynamoDB for database management, Lambda Functions for serverless computing, and API Gateway for efficient routing. For the front-end, I’ve used React to ensure a dynamic and responsive user interface.

One key feature of the console is its capability to generate tweets and comments rapidly, a function that is part of a broader set of tools aimed at automating and enhancing online campaigns. The tool employs AI-driven prompt engineering and integrates with OpenAI’s GPT API to create targeted posts. This particular feature serves as an invaluable asset for businesses and organizations that need to maintain a strong and authentic media presence in the face of challenges like misinformation.
