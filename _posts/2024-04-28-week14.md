title: Week 14 - Project Progress
---

Some changes have taken place in the project. Due to the challenges of working with the Spicetify API Wrapper, we have come to a decision to change an idea for the app. Now, instead of it having playlists from user's library, and search functionality, it will be an app with a sleek timer of 25 minutes and 5 minute break. Below the timer, we will have our recommended playlists that will be hardcoded in the app - they are the playlists that we recommended using when studying or working. Users would be able to click them and be redirected to their location in Spotify. We ran through the presentation, and have now been able to combine the theme with the app, although they can still function separately. Coming to this decision of changing the playlist idea so late due to technical difficulties was not very easy, but we believe that it was necessary to deliver a good working product.
