title: Week 15 - Project Presentations Reflection
---

This week we presented our work on Spicetify to the class and thought that it went very well. The work that we have done on the project was complete and because of the nature of our contribution, it was nice to do a live demo. Our timing was good, and the speaking duration spread also seemed to be rather equal, since we assigned roles, and practiced before presenting. Overall I think it was a good experience and a success. Listening to other groups' presentations was also interesting, and from what it seems, everyone has done a good job. My favorite presentation was Git Lab i think, because of how passionate that team spoke about the project, and from how welcoming and active the project is in general. I will definitely take some time after graduating to look into it and will consider contributing to it, as it seemed fun and good for experience.

The class was fantastic, and am thankful to have been exposed to open source. Cannot wait to see what the future holds for me in this field. Will continue contributing in one project or another!
